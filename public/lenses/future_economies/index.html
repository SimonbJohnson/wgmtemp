		<h3>IMPLICATION</h3>
		<p>As economies undergo a transition from production of goods to provision of services they start to relate more to the benefits of science, trust scientists more to provide accurate information - and are also more skeptical about science’s ability to increase jobs. </p>

		<h3>CASE STUDY</h3>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-8 offset-md-2">
				<p class="wellcomeheader">INDIA</p>
				<p>India is representative of an economy which is currently undergoing this transition — In 2019, 42.39 percent of the workforce in India were employed in agriculture, while the other half was almost evenly distributed among the two other sectors, industry and services.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-8 offset-md-2">
				<p>Indians who are full time employed are just as likely to believe science & technology will increase jobs than those who are not.</p>
				<p>Those people who had a negative experience on the day before the survey were 1.5 times more likely to say science and technology will decrease jobs and not improve life for the next generation.</p>
				<p>Given Wellcome’s focus on improving mental health at the workplace — we were interested in learning more:</p>
				<h1>Mental health is an issue for India’s traditional, informal and modern workplaces.</h1>
				<p>Close to 81% of all employed persons in India make a living by working in the informal sector, with only 6.5% in the formal sector.2 Despite being the majority sector, there is a lack of research documenting the prevalence of mental health disorders in the unorganised sector — in the absence of broader proxies, we have used the extreme statistic of occupation-related suicides to highlight contextual challenges.3</p>

		<h3>CONTEXTUAL CHALLENGE</h3>
		<h2>A tradition in transition impacts women’s mental health</h2>
		<p>Entrenched patriarchal social norms hinder women’s agency, mobility and  freedom to work in India. Indian women spend on average of 5.8 hours on unpaid work at home everyday against 52 minutes for men 4. These “nonworking” women have 1.2 times higher anxiety 1.3 times higher stress than “working” women 5. They represent the second highest suicide risk (according to profession) - believed to be a reflection of the conflicted roles in which Indian women find themselves as society undergoes social change6.</p>

		<h3>CONTEXTUAL CHALLENGE</h3>
		<h2>Everyday uncertainty for daily wage earners</h2>
		<h3>450 million</h3>
		<p>Of the 450 million people7 employed in the informal sector, millions work as dailywage earners. These ‘naka’ workers — Painters, masons, plumbers and labourers — gather at street corners every morning, waiting to be picked up by a contractor in return for a small wage. As a profession - they are at highest risk for suicide in India8  — and face challenges regarding safety, sense of belonging, group membership, control over one’s life, competence, closeness with peers and nurturing adults9.</p>

		<h3>CONTEXTUAL CHALLENGE</h3>
		<h2>A pressurised workplace for modern workers</h2>
		<h3>12 MILLION PEOPLE</h3>
		<p>Private sector companies symbolize the modern indian workplace and employ around 12 million Indians10. They are highly stressed environments with demanding schedules — In 2015, 42.5% of employees in private sectors self-reported as being affected by depression or general anxiety disorder11. </p>
